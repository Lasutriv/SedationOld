# What Is The Current Stage
Although the project has been worked on for countless hours, it is nowhere near completition. It does allow for multiple scenes within multiple levels if you have the full code. 

Some simple takeaways:
* Skeleton of a government user interface system
* Character inventory management
* Command console to allow custom item spawning

Reminder, this repository is only a fraction of the code.
